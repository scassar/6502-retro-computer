# 6502 Retro Computer

## Summary

Setting up a repository for my current project on building a retro computer from scratch using a 6502 CPU. My goal is to use this Github repository as a blog of sorts. This CPU will be based off the great work by Ben Eater and his youtube series, but I have a wishlist of enhancements I am going to add to enhance the build. 

This build is currently in planning while I work on the design and components I would like to include.

The wishlist scope of my build is as per below: 

Main board:
- 32k Ram / ROM
- Running Apple Wozmon software alongside Microsoft Basic
- Dual line LCD display module
- 1 VIA supporting keyboard and LCD display
- Development and printing of a PCB
- 3d Printed Computer plastic case to spec

I/O 
- Serial interface port to VGA output
- PS/2 keyboard support
- Also support serial direct to PC (potentially use computer as the IO, or build in a small RPI
