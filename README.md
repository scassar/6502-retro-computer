# 6502 Retro cCmputer

## Summary

Setting up a repository for my active project on building a retro computer from scratch using a 6502 CPU. This CPU will be based off the great work by Ben Eater and his series, but I have a wishlist of enhancements I am going to factor in. The current scope of my build is as per below: 

Main board:
- 32k Ram / ROM
- Running Apple Wozmon software alongside Microsoft Basic
- Dual line LCD display module
- 1 VIA supporting keyboard and LCD display

I/O 
- Serial interface port to VGA output
- PS/2 keyboard support
- Also support serial direct to PC (potentially use computer as the IO, or build in a small RPI
